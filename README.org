* Calc Prog
This is a small extension to the Emacs calc package. It aims to do the following:
- Add common IEC binary units
  - Multi-byte units found at
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Multiple-byte_units
- Easier shifting functions with
  - =prog-shift-left-by=
  - =prog-shift-right-by=
- Masking function with
  - =prog-mask=
- Kill number to =0xNNN= format, suitable for programming languages that support that.
  - =prog-hex-kill=
